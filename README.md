# legacy-ehap #
This repository is part of a series of repositories documenting the code I wrote when I was first learning computer programming. Please do not use this repository to evaluate my professional software development skills. I keep these legacy repositories on Github for myself in order to look back on this code with nostalgia.

This code was last updated *March 25th, 2014*.
This code was committed to GitHub *October 2nd, 2017*.

EHAP was a protocol I developed in 2014 for home automation. The system worked, and I was able to control a garage door via wifi for a few weeks. However, the system was over-complicated, difficult to standardize, and implemented poorly.

It was later replaced by the solution using REST, Angular, Node, and Arduino found here:
